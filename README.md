This library aims to enable individuals to effectively create story map applications over the Internet. Three major tasks would be dealt with, including web interface design, map design and storytelling structure. To develop these functions, this library is written in a combination of several web programming languages, like HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript, and builds upon several prerequisite libraries and web services. To make the story map library robust and lightweight, we select as fewer prerequisite libraries as possible, and prioritize the use of open source or free libraries. This library is currently maintained by <a href="http://geoviz.ceoas.oregonstate.edu" rel="nofollow">Cartography and Geovisualization Group</a> at Oregon State University, and has been used in multiple geovisualization related courses (e.g., GEOG 371: Web Mapping, GEOG 4/572: Geovisual Analytics) and projects.</p>
<p>A storymap is organically integrated by several scenes. Each scene consists of a web map and a script. You can manipulate the map by zooming, panning, and even adding more thematic layers. This library embodies the concept responsive web design, meaning the storymaps can be shown on either Desktop or mobile devices.</p>
